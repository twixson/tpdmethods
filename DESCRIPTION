Description: Recent work in multivariate extremes is built on the so-called tail 
    pairwise dependence (TPD). This summary metric of dependence in the pairwise 
    tail shares properties with covariance and this recent work has used these 
    properties to construct extremal analogues to classical statistical tools 
    including PCA and ARMA time series models. We implement these extremal 
    analysis pipelines in this R package 'tpdmethods'. The package includes 
    datasets and vignettes for precipitation and fire weather analyses.
